/* The chapter script's turn-event table, in the resident MAP%02d.DAT block
   reached through data_fdps_tile_event_data_table_ptr (gamedata.h).  Sixteen
   fixed entries of three bytes each start at offset 3 of the block, right
   behind its three header bytes, of which +1 and +2 are the two counts
   fdps_field_load_chapter_resources publishes (rsrc.c).  MOV dword ptr
   [EBP-0x4],0x0 / CMP dword ptr [EBP-0x4],0x10 for the count,
   LEA EAX,[EAX+EAX*0x2] for the stride, and the +0x3, +0x4, +0x5
   displacements for the three fields.

   Nothing in the block says how many of the sixteen are in use.  The shipped
   maps fill the unused ones with turn 0xff, handler 0xff, side 0x00, which no
   turn counter ever matches -- the walk runs all sixteen regardless and the
   filler simply never fires. */

   name, and it pushes a literal.  The slot's argument is a unit index and 0 is
   a valid one, not a "none" marker, so a handler that does read its argument
   reads unit 0 here. */

   [0x00069cd8] / ADD EDX,EAX / OR byte ptr [EAX+0x5],0x80.  The whole function
   is that: one record address formed inline and one bit ORed into the status
   byte.  There is no CALL, no branch and no return value.

   The multiply is IMUL, the signed one, and the index arrives as a full dword
   argument that nothing compares against data_fdps_map_unit_count first.  Both
   halves are reproduced deliberately: a caller that passes an out-of-range or
   negative index gets the byte outside the array written, which is what the
   original does, and adding the bound check the original does not have would
   change behaviour rather than protect anything.  All nine call sites reach
   here holding an index the phase engine has just been iterating over, so
   nothing in the image is known to depend on that -- see the open issue.

   OR, not MOV: bit 0 of the same byte is the retired flag, and a unit that
   died on its own turn is marked done afterwards.  Storing 0x80 would clear
   that flag and resurrect it. */

/* 0002e0c0.  A counted walk over the whole sixteen-entry table -- there is no
   early exit anywhere in the body, the only backward branch is the loop's own
   JMP 0x0002e0de -- so every entry carrying this turn and this side fires, in
   table order, and a handler that schedules another event for the same turn
   and a later slot has it fired on the same pass.

   Both tests are equality, JNZ and JZ, on a byte widened with AND EAX,0xff.
   The turn byte is therefore unsigned: 0xff matches a turn counter of 255, not
   of -1 (contract C).  The counter itself is the int at data_fdps_battle_turn_counter,
   which starts at 1 and is bumped once per turn cycle, so entries scheduled
   for turn 0 are unreachable.

   MOV EDX,dword ptr [0x0006013c] is inside the loop body, once per field read:
   the block pointer is re-read on every iteration and a handler that reloaded
   the chapter -- fdps_field_load_chapter_resources frees this block and
   replaces it -- would have the rest of the walk read the new one.  Written
   that way here, with the entry address formed fresh each pass.

   The handler slot is the raw byte, scaled by four straight into the call,
   LEA EAX,[EAX*0x4 + 0x0] / CALL dword ptr [EAX+0x601c4] with no comparison
   against the table's fifty entries.  A map naming slot 50 or higher would
   call whatever lies past the table; the shipped maps use slots 0 to 44. */
