/* tests/rleturn.c -- cover for src/rleturn.asm: the two rotating kernels.
 *
 * The kernels in rleturn.asm are hand-written assembly transcribed from the
 * original with no C interface -- they take their inputs in registers and out
 * of fdps_blit_dispatch's own stack frame -- so every case here calls
 * fdps_blit_dispatch with the kernel's mode.  The cases carry over every
 * situation the C-translation tests in tests/rlerot.c verify (those are kept
 * for reference under #if 0), and none of them depends on which spelling of
 * the kernels is linked (rebuild_info/emit_pipeline.md).
